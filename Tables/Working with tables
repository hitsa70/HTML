  <p>It serves as a reminder that Kellenberg is a family and it is fitting that the Holy Family is the first greeting the students receive as they enter the building. The mural was designed by artist Yan Rieger and was executed during the summer of
    1997 in honor of Kellenberg's tenth anniversary. It is unusual in that it depicts Jesus as a teenager. And, reflecting the family emphasis of Kellenberg, the mural was worked on not only by the artist but also by his wife, various members of
    the student body and the Marianist community </p>
